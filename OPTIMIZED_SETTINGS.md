## üöÄ How It Works

### Entry Signal
When a crypto drops ‚â•4.5% in 5 minutes:
- Bot enters with 100% of available capital
- Sets break-even price (covering fees)
- Activates trailing stop at 0.7% below peak

### Exit Conditions
1. **Target Profit** - Exit if price hits +4% gain
2. **Min Profit** - After 5 min, allow exit at +2% if trailing stop hits
3. **Trailing Stop** - Exit if price drops 0.7% from peak (after min hold time)
4. **Stop Loss** - Exit at -3% to limit losses
5. **Max Hold** - Force exit after 15 minutes

---

## üí∞ Capital Allocation

- **100% per trade** - All available capital (minus fees)
- **Formula:** `spend_amount = balance / (1 + buy_fee_rate)`
- **Min Trade:** $10 USD
- **Reserve:** None (aggressive strategy)
