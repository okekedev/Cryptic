## üìã Configuration (.env Settings)

```bash
# Dump Detection (more opportunities with -3% threshold)
PRICE_DROP_THRESHOLD=3.0
PRICE_WINDOW_MINUTES=5

# Entry Strategy (better fills at -1% below dump)
USE_LIMIT_ORDERS=yes
LIMIT_BUY_EXTRA_PCT=1.0
LIMIT_ORDER_TIMEOUT_MINUTES=2.0

# Exit Strategy (simple +6% beats ladder strategies)
DUMP_TARGET_PROFIT=6.0
DUMP_MIN_PROFIT_TARGET=6.0
DUMP_MAX_LOSS_PERCENT=3.0
DUMP_MAX_HOLD_TIME_MINUTES=60.0
USE_LADDER_SELLS=no  # Simple limit sells are more profitable

# Position Sizing
DUMP_INITIAL_CAPITAL=175.0
DUMP_POSITION_SIZE_PERCENT=11.43
DUMP_MAX_CONCURRENT_POSITIONS=8
```

## üî¨ Why This Strategy Wins

### 1. **Lower Threshold = More Opportunities**
- 3% dumps occur more frequently than 4% dumps
- More trades = more profit opportunities
- Still significant enough for bounce potential

### 2. **Better Entry Price (-1% vs -0.5%)**
- Entering 1% below dump price improves cost basis
- Better average entry = higher profit margins
- Still fills reliably (proven in backtest)

### 3. **Optimal Exit Target (6% vs 2% or 8%)**
- 2% exits too early (leaves money on table)
- 8% exits too late (price rarely reaches it)
- 6% is the "sweet spot" for dump bounce recoveries

### 4. **Simple Limit Sells Beat Ladders**
- Ladder strategies sound good in theory
- But they underperform vs simple +6% limit sells
- Simpler = fewer missed exits, better fills

### 5. **Tight 1-Hour Hold Time**
- Forces discipline - don't hold losers too long
- Bounce happens within 60 min or doesn't happen
- Frees up capital for next opportunity
